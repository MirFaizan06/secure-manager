   Use 12-16+ characters with mixed character types.

3. BACKUP REGULARLY
   Create weekly backups and store in multiple locations.
   Test your backups by restoring occasionally.

4. GENERATE STRONG PASSWORDS
   Use the built-in generator for all new passwords.
   Aim for 16+ characters with all character types.

5. ORGANIZE WITH CATEGORIES
   Use categories like "Work", "Personal", "Banking", etc.
   Makes searching and managing passwords easier.

   Use document storage for:
